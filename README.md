# Hey, I'm Eleni üëã

**Software Engineer** with an unusual path: anthropology ‚Üí customer experience ‚Üí code.

I discovered programming while working at a scaling startup, where exposure to simple problem-solving and automation sparked something. That led me to start seriously learning web development 1.5 years ago through an online bootcamp, and the passion just grew from there. Recently placed 3rd in a 24-hour hackathon, building a community platform for discovering "third spaces" in cities.

My background in anthropology taught me to understand users and systems from different perspectives. My customer experience work showed me what good software looks like to real people. Now I get to combine those insights with technical skills to build meaningful solutions.

I specialise in **web development** and **no-code automations** ‚Äì finding the right tool for each problem.

## üîß Current Project

**‚ö° [Job Search AI Assistant](https://github.com/elenisal94/job-search-ai)** 

AI has complicated the job search process significantly over the past few years. As someone currently navigating this space for coding opportunities, I decided to build a solution that leverages AI to streamline the process rather than complicate it further.

**Features:**
- **Job matching** using GitHub Jobs, Reed.co.uk, and Indeed APIs
- **AI-generated cover letters** via LangChain + LLMs for personalized applications
- **CV-job matching** with RAG to better understand role alignment
- **LinkedIn integration** to streamline profile data and application processes

## üéØ What Drives Me

I love love building something original or fixing problems through trial and error. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking a complex challenge and breaking it down into manageable pieces, then watching those pieces come together into a working solution.

The speed at which we can develop and iterate now is genuinely exciting ‚Äì you can move from concept to working prototype faster than ever before.
